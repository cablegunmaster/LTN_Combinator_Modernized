Version: 2.0.3
Date: 2023-05-03

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2023-05-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed 2.0.0 migration issue that can result in lost thresholds when placing blueprints from
      migrated combinators (or copy paste)
  Features:
    - Added a command to "disable: the requester service on all combinators that do not have a
      negative item or fluid signal configured.

      This version of the combinator more accurately reflects how the signals are controlling
      the station.  The previous versions imperfectly guessed how to display requester / provider
      services based on signals that were configured.  Now this check box is more deterministic
      and specifically controls requester and provider thresholds.  Therefore many combinators
      that appeared to be provider only in previous versions now look like the are both 
      provider and requester because there is not a high-request threshold set.

      /ltnc-unset-requester
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2023-04-30
  Bugfixes:
    - Added close sound
  Changes:
    - Complete rewrite from scratch.
    - The UI has been revamped considerably, but retains general feel.
    - Now using current FLIB library
    - All signals are always visible.  No more hiding parts of the combinator.
    - Likely many more, as well as a few new bugs.  Please report.
  Features:
    - Able to open and paste settings from map and long distance (treat like a train station).
      Note: may interact poorly with RemoteConfiguration Mod.
    - Can disable provider / requester services of the station via the combinator.
      This sends high thresholds into the station and retains the values so they can be reenabled.
    - I'm sure I've added new bugs in this process.  Please report them and any missing features
      or non-intuitive behavior.
  Info:
    - Pulled version 2.0.0 from downloads as it had a major issue that could result
      in combinator setting loss when copy/pasting or blueprinting from combinators created prior
      to 2.0.0.

      setting is enabled. Explicit NetID can be removed by selecting "None" in the config dialog.
      This will revert to following the LTN configured default implicilty.
        Note: If the LTN default network is changed, explicily set combinators will not change
              automatically.
    - Newly built Requester LTN Combinators from blueprints or copy / cut / paste operations will be
      set to disabled by default.
